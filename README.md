# Sketch-Photo-Conversion
Preliminary results of a neural network we implemented by using 6 convolutional layers. Here, we use ReLU activation function in the Ô¨Årst 5 layers and a linear activation function in the last layer. We use mean square error loss function. 
train.ipynb is for training and evaluating the convolutional network.
photo2sketch generates grayscale sketches from facial images to obtain the training set.
